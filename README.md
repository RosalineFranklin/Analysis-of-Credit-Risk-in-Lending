This end to end project started with the question: Cedar Crest Financial Bank wanted to uncover the different risks of credit for the 2024 year.
Insights uncovered through analysis indicated that debt to income, annual income, age, and credit score might be these key risk factors.

Tasks performed:
	We took a dataset, cleaned and transformed it, and loaded it into Microsoft Power BI for analysis.
	We created a dashboard using our transformed data and used DAX to create measures.
	We then wrote a Credit Risk Analysis Report showing the different risk factors our company faced with lending money to prospective clients.
Attached in this project:
	The SQL Queries I made.
	Our Credit Risk Analysis Dashboard and data model I made using Microsoft Power BI.
	The credit risk analysis report showing our findings.
